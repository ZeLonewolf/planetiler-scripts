Scripts for building planetiler

1. You want to render a vector OpenMapTiles planet within AWS, see ([aws](aws/README.md))
2. You want to render a vector OpenMapTiles planet locally and upload to AWS, see ([local](local/README.md))

These scripts are customized for my particular setup, you will likely need to customize for your use case.
